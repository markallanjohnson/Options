# Options Hedging Calculator

## Overview
This project includes two Python scripts: `calculate_hedge.py` and `get_option_prices.py`. The `calculate_hedge.py` script is designed to calculate the best hedging strategy for a given portfolio using put options on a specified ticker (default SPY), taking into account the portfolio value, a percentage out of the money for the options, and other factors. The `get_option_prices.py` script retrieves option prices (calls and puts) for a given ticker and expiration date.
